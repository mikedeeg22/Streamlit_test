# Streamlit_test
Creating streamlit app using the 20 news articles dataset

This app takes a user entered list of articles ID's (article_list.py will create a 1000 sample list that can be manually copied and pasted into the text input box), and then classify these documents into different categories.  The topic of each category is informed by the top keywords table.  Users can modify the number of clusters, add stopwords, components for dimensionality reduction, and other settings.
